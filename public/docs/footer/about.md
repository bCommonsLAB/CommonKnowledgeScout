# **About Knowledge Scout**


## **A Collaborative Adventure Project**

Knowledge Scout is not a finished product — it is a **digital laboratory** exploring how AI can be used as a tool for collective learning.  
It is experimental, open, and non-commercial. All results, texts, and answers are intermediate steps in an ongoing inquiry — not official or scientifically validated statements.


## **The Idea: Don’t Ask AI — Ask Collective Knowledge**

Instead of producing generic AI answers, Knowledge Scout makes **curated, collective knowledge** accessible.  
Every answer is rooted in real talks, publications, and documents — with transparent citations for every source.
AI acts as a **mediator, not an inventor**.  
It reformulates existing content, but does not create or hallucinate new information.


## **How It Works**

**1. Explore Knowledge Libraries**
Choose a library (e.g., SFSCon Talks, South Tyrol Biodiversity) and browse the available material to get an overview of its themes.

**2. Filter Topics**
Narrow down by year, theme, speaker, or track to find exactly what matters to you.

**3. Switch to Story Mode**
Activate Story Mode to generate a topic overview tailored to your selection.  
Ask your own questions or follow suggested ones to dive deeper into the material.

**4. Adjust Your Perspective**
Tell the system how you want answers to be written: choose your language, preferred style, and context (for example, everyday understanding, scientific view, youth-friendly, senior-friendly, professional, or easy language).  
The underlying knowledge stays the same — but the way it is explained adapts to your perspective, so you can relate it to your needs and lived experience.
