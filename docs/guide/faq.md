# FAQ

## Why don't I see a library?
Check `/settings` → Library and `/settings/storage`. At least one library must be actively configured.

## How do I switch libraries?
Select library in header (dropdown). Alternatively, set URL parameter `?activeLibraryId=...` once.

## Why doesn't transcription/transformation start?
Missing configuration or permissions. Check Event Monitor for error messages and `/settings/secretary-service`.

## Where do I see job progress?
In `/event-monitor`. There you can filter batches/jobs, view details, and restart if needed.

## Supported file formats?
Audio (e.g., MP3/WAV), Images (PNG/JPG), PDF, Markdown/Text. For additional formats see Concepts or Release Notes.
