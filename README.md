# Common Knowledge Stack

**An open research and development project for commons-oriented knowledge infrastructures.**

The Common Knowledge Stack explores how distributed information (audio, video, documents, and images) can be transformed into structured, accessible, and collectively negotiated knowledge — outside commercial logic and with transparency at every step.

---

## 🧩 Structure

The Common Knowledge Stack follows a file-sharing approach to knowledge distribution, designed to work both server-side and **locally** (with a planned Electron-based desktop implementation). The architecture consists of:

### Core Components..

- **Knowledge Scout** – Next.js web application that currently runs server-side but is **prepared for local execution** with a planned Electron implementation. It provides the main interface for organizing, publishing, and exploring knowledge. It features an **abstracted storage layer** with three drivers:
  - **Local File System** – Direct access to files on your computer
  - **OneDrive** – Integration with Microsoft OneDrive for cloud storage.
  - **Nextcloud** – Integration with Nextcloud for self-hosted cloud storage (in development)
  
  This storage abstraction allows you to organize files locally and share knowledge through file sharing, independent of where the files are physically stored. The abstraction layer enables seamless transition between server-side and local desktop deployment. **The goal is to achieve absolute sovereignty over your own data** and migrate from locked-in scenarios to self-organized scenarios where you can share knowledge with others while maintaining full control over your information.

- **Secretary Service** – External Python service that helps transform media files (audio, video, PDFs, images) in your file system into structured Markdown documents. It processes raw materials and creates "shadow twin" Markdown files alongside the originals.

- **Knowledge Library & Chat** – Built on top of the transformed Markdown files, these tools enable:
  - **Gallery** – Publishing and organizing knowledge for discovery
  - **Chat & story mode** – Dialog-based exploration using RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)

### Workflow

The typical workflow follows this path:

1. **Content Collection** → 
   - **File Organization**: Store media files (PDFs, audio, video) in your chosen storage (local, OneDrive, or Nextcloud)
   - **Web Scraping**: Scrape websites to collect event data, talks, slides, video transcripts, and web content (e.g., using the Session Manager)
2. **Transformation** → Secretary Service transforms these files and scraped content into structured Markdown documents. For events and talks, this includes extracting slides, video transcripts, web text, and metadata into organized Markdown files
3. **Knowledge Layer** → Use the Markdown files to build galleries and enable chat-based exploration
4. **Sharing** → Share knowledge through file sharing, making the transformed content accessible to others

## 🚀 Installation

### Docker (Recommended for Production)

The easiest way to deploy Common Knowledge Scout is using Docker. A pre-built image is available on GitHub Container Registry:

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/bcommonslab/commonkno:latest
```

### Docker Compose

For a complete setup with all required environment variables, use Docker Compose. An example configuration file is provided: [`docker-compose.example.yml`](./docker-compose.example.yml)

Copy the example file and customize it with your configuration:

```bash
cp docker-compose.example.yml docker-compose.yml
# Edit docker-compose.yml with your settings
docker-compose up -d
```

### Local Development

For local development and contribution:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone [repository-url]
cd CommonKnowledgeScout

# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Configure environment variables
cp .env.example .env.local
# Edit .env.local with your configuration

# Start development server
pnpm dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Environment Variables

The application requires several environment variables to be configured. Create a `.env.local` file (for development) or `.env` file (for production) based on `.env.example`.

#### Application Settings

| Variable | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` | Yes | Application URL (e.g., `http://localhost:3000` or production URL) |
| `PORT` | No | Next.js port (default: 3000) |

#### Internal Security

| Variable | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `INTERNAL_TEST_TOKEN` | Recommended | Shared secret for internal server-to-server calls. Used as `X-Internal-Token` header. **Required in production** to prevent callback failures. |
| `INTERNAL_SELF_BASE_URL` | No | Base URL for internal self-calls (e.g., `http://127.0.0.1:3000`). Falls back to request origin or `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL`. |

#### Secretary Service

| Variable | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `SECRETARY_SERVICE_URL` | Yes | URL of the Secretary Service API endpoint |
| `SECRETARY_SERVICE_API_KEY` | Yes | API key for authenticating with the Secretary Service |
| `EXTERNAL_REQUEST_TIMEOUT_MS` | No | Timeout for external requests (default: 600000 ms) |
| `EXTERNAL_TEMPLATE_TIMEOUT_MS` | No | Timeout for template processing (default: 600000 ms) |
| `ANALYZE_REQUEST_TIMEOUT_MS` | No | Timeout for internal analyze calls (default: 120000 ms) |

#### MongoDB

| Variable | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `MONGODB_URI` | Yes | MongoDB connection string |
| `MONGODB_DATABASE_NAME` | Yes | Database name |
| `MONGODB_COLLECTION_NAME` | No | Collection name (default: `libraries`) |
| `CREDENTIALS_ENCRYPTION_KEY` | Yes¹ | 32-byte key (Base64 or Hex) for AES-256-GCM encryption-at-rest of stored storage credentials. Generate: `openssl rand -base64 32`. ¹Required as soon as any library stores credentials. After setting it, migrate existing plaintext via `pnpm tsx scripts/migrate-encrypt-credentials.ts`. Keep the key stable — without it the encrypted secrets cannot be read. |

#### LLM Chat Configuration

**Note:** All LLM calls are routed through the Secretary Service. The Secretary Service API key is configured via `SECRETARY_SERVICE_API_KEY` (see Secretary Service section above).

**Required environment variables:**
- `QUESTION_ANALYZER_MODEL`: Model for question analysis (required, no fallback)
- `QUESTION_ANALYZER_TEMPERATURE`: Temperature for question analysis (required, no fallback)

**Optional environment variables:**
- `LLM_CHAT_TIMEOUT_MS`: Timeout for LLM chat requests in milliseconds (default: `240000` = 240 seconds)

**API Requirements:**

## 📖 Workflows

### Library Setup

Create and configure a library to organize your knowledge base. Libraries serve as containers for documents, media files, and transformed content. Each library can have its own storage provider, access settings, and vector database configuration.

**Learn more:** [Library Setup Use Case](./docs/use-cases/library-setup.md)

### File Transformation

Transform various file formats into structured Markdown documents:

- **PDFs**: Extract text, images, and structure from PDF documents → [PDF Transformation Use Case](./docs/use-cases/file-transformation-pdf.md)
- **Audio/Video**: Transcribe audio and video files to text with speaker identification → [Media Transformation Use Case](./docs/use-cases/file-transformation-media.md)
- **Images**: Extract text using OCR and generate descriptions

Transformed files are saved as "shadow twins" alongside the original files, preserving the source while providing searchable, structured content.

**Batch Processing:** Process multiple files simultaneously → [Batch Operations Use Case](./docs/use-cases/batch-operations.md)

### Web Scraping & Event Import

Scrape and import content from websites using the Event Monitor. Extract structured data from web pages, convert them to Markdown format, and import them into your library. Useful for capturing event information, session data, and web-based content.

**Learn more:** [Web Scraping Use Case](./docs/use-cases/web-scraping.md)

### Gallery Publishing

Publish and organize transformed content in public or private galleries. Galleries provide a web interface for browsing, searching, and accessing knowledge. Content can be organized by tags, categories, and custom metadata.

**Learn more:** [Publishing Use Case](./docs/use-cases/publishing.md)

### Chat & Story Mode

Query your knowledge base using natural language. The Chat & story interface uses RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) to find relevant content and generate answers based on your library's documents. Supports filtering by metadata, facets, and custom queries.

**Learn more:** [Chat & Story Mode Use Case](./docs/use-cases/chat-exploration.md)
